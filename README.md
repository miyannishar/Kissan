Inspiration

Farmers still grow their plants, seeds, and crops today without the aid of technology or the right understanding of the soil. They only raise the crops in accordance with their needs. When the crops don't develop properly, they employ toxic liquids, medications, and sanitizers. Even the health of the people is being affected, which is an issue for society. As a result, we did some research and found one solution for this and thatâ€™s Kissan. Kissan was created with the goal of using the extraordinary amount of data currently accessible to discover the best sustainable farming method in the future.

What it does?

Our initiative, Kissan, uses detailed live data on the temperature, moisture content, and soil nutrition. This project consists of two parts: a farmer component and an expert portion. The farmer first gets onto the website, searches for the soil/land specialist, and then simply schedules an appointment with the chosen expert. And when the expert visits the farmer's field, he or she also carries a gadget that measures the soil's temperature, pressure, and moisture content and its percentage. Using all of these factors, the expert may easily forecast which crops would thrive on a certain soil. The farmer will benefit from this by not suffering a loss and the proper amount of crops can be grown.

How we built?

Kissan was created with Arduino, temperature sensor, moisture sensor, and other IOT modules in the hardware and PostgreSQL, express, react, and node.js was in the software. The weather API was used to obtain the weather.
